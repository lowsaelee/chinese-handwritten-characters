# Chinese Handwritten Characters

Dataset is obtained from Kaggle of 15 different handwritten Chinese characters of 1000 sets each character. These can be used to train a model to recognized handwritten Chinese characters. I turned this into a binary classification project limiting myself to only two characters for the classification. I ran several machine learning classification algorithms on these two sets of Chinese characters and looked at its evaluations on predicting the handwritten Chinese character.
